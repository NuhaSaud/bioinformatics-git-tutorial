# Bioinformatics Git & GitHub Tutorial — Choose Your Learning Path

Welcome! This repository teaches bioinformatics researchers how to use Git for version control and collaboration using **three learning paths**:

- **📱 GitHub Desktop (Beginner-Friendly)**
- **💻 VSCode (Best for documentation & daily writing)**
- **⌨️ Command Line (Power users & servers)**

> All examples use plain **.md** and **.txt** files—no code or CSV—so your team can practice safely.

## What is Git and Why Do We Need It?

### What is Version Control?
Think of version control as a **"time machine"** for your files. Just like you might save different versions of a document as:
- `Protocol_v1.docx`
- `Protocol_v2_final.docx` 
- `Protocol_v2_final_REAL.docx`

Git does this automatically and much more efficiently!

### Why Bioinformatics Researchers Need Git:
- 📄 **Track changes** in analysis protocols, documentation, and data files
- 🤝 **Collaborate** with team members on research projects
- 💾 **Backup** your work automatically
- 🔄 **Restore** previous versions if something breaks
- 📝 **Document** what you did and when you did it

### Real-World Bioinformatics Examples:
- Sharing analysis protocols between lab members
- Tracking changes to experimental procedures
- Collaborating on grant proposals and papers
- Managing data analysis documentation
- Version controlling bioinformatics workflows

## Create GitHub Account
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Choose a professional username (e.g., `firstname-lastname` or `firstnamelastname`)
4. Use your institutional email if available


## 🎯 Which Method Should You Choose?

### [📱 GitHub Desktop Method](./github-desktop-method/) — *Recommended for Beginners*
- Visual, point-and-click
- Fastest start, no terminal
- Great for documents and protocols

### [💻 VSCode Method](./vscode-method/) — *Best for Active Writers*
- Editor + Git in one place
- Live preview & collaboration
- Ideal for lab protocols & docs

### [⌨️ Command Line Method](./command-line-method/) — *Most Powerful*
- Works locally and on servers
- Fast and flexible
- Industry standard

## 🚀 Quick Start Paths
- “I just want to start now” → **[GitHub Desktop](./github-desktop-method/)**  
- “I write a lot of README/protocols” → **[VSCode](./vscode-method/)**  
- “I work on servers/SSH” → **[Command Line](./command-line-method/)**

## 🧪 Bioinformatics Examples (No Code)
- Managing DNA extraction protocols (`protocols/*.md`)  
- Tracking manuscript and SOP updates  
- Collaborating on analysis planning notes
