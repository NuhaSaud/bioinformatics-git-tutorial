# 02 — Daily Workflow (VSCode)

## Core Loop
Pull → Edit → Stage → Commit → Push

## Practice
- Create/edit `protocols/pcr-setup.md`
- Stage partial changes in diff view
- Commit: “Add PCR thermocycler settings” → Push

## Branching
- Bottom-left branch name → **Create new branch…** (`protocol-improvements`) → edit → commit → push.
